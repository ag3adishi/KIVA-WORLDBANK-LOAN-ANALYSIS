ðŸ“Š Random Forest Model Evaluation
=======================================

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model using a confusion matrix and classification report. These metrics help us assess how well the model classifies loan funding outcomes.

ðŸ”¹ Classification Report:

              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      1.00      1.00      9671
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00    124570

    accuracy                           1.00    134241
   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00    134241
weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00    134241

ðŸ§  Insights:
- âœ… Perfect Precision, Recall, and F1-Score across both classes.
- âœ… Zero false positives and false negatives â€” 100% accurate.
- ðŸ“Š Model is not only highly accurate but also handles class imbalance perfectly here.
- ðŸš€ Performance is better than Logistic Regression, but may need validation to avoid overfitting.

Random Forest appears to be a highly effective model for predicting Kiva loan funding â€” possibly even outperforming Logistic Regression in terms of robustness.
