üìä Logistic Regression Model Evaluation
=======================================

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the Logistic Regression model using a confusion matrix and classification report. These metrics help us understand how well the model is performing in terms of precision, recall, and overall accuracy.

üîπ Classification Report:

              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      0.99      0.99      9671
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00    124570

    accuracy                           1.00    134241
   macro avg       1.00      0.99      1.00    134241
weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00    134241

üß† Insights:
- ‚úÖ High Precision & Recall for both classes (especially class 1 ‚Äì Funded).
- ‚úÖ Perfect Recall for class 1, meaning no funded loan was missed.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slight imbalance noticed: majority of data belongs to class 1.
- üìà Overall Accuracy is extremely high: 0.9992

This indicates that Logistic Regression is a strong baseline model for predicting Kiva loan funding outcomes.
